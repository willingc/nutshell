Clean content: This post is about Rust, so it will attract considerable attention from Rust fans. As a result, most of the comments are likely to be positive (since they come from Rust fans). We still need to wait and see. but eventually will become a required dependency of CPython and allowed to be used throughout the CPython code base <del> Additionally, using Rust (which relies on LLVM) means abandoning many niche platforms.  Is this really an appropriate choice? Many popular open-source projects use Python to some extent.  If CPython drops support for certain platforms, those platforms will no longer be able to run many projects that depend on Python. That would be truly unfortunate! Rust may mitigate some memory-related issues, but… are you really in such a hurry to introduce Rust into CPython? In any case, Rust should be made optional. This way, maintainers of (Python-dependent) open-source projects can choose whether to use the Rust-dependent features or not. They deserve to have a choice! Moreover, making Rust a mandatory dependency for CPython sounds like a proposal driven by Rust fans to push their own agenda. </dev> Perhaps we can wait until the maturity of the following options: C++26: hardening and contract Zig gcc-rs After that, we can conduct more comparisons before making a final decision.
