Clean content: To achieve good ergonomics, we’ll need not only cpython-sys but also another crate built on top of it that provides proper Rust abstractions. (Following naming conventions, it would be called cpython , but that name is already taken.) Right now, the PEP only covers cpython-sys , but if we expect Rust ergonomics by this PEP, I think some consideration of this additional crate should also be included.
