Clean content: Zander-1024: If all proceeds smoothly, we might eventually achieve a RustPython that remains compatible with the C ABI. That said, RustPython already exists today, though it still lags behind CPython in terms of features and ecosystem. Wouldn’t steadily improving it be a more feasible path forward? This approach may prove more manageable than integrating Rust directly into CPython. Whenever I see arguments like this, I get the impression that the people making such an argument forget what “volunteer” means. If they’re not getting paid to work on Python, then it’s entirely possible that it’s not “Rust vs. C”, but “Rust vs. wear out and stop contributing”. I know that situation is why I’m rewriting my Python projects in Rust. Even without memory safety on the line and even with strict-mode MyPy, the constant vigilance of a dynamic language with ubiquitous NULL/None/nil and exceptions introducing hidden return paths all over the place wears on me.
