Clean content: Brett Cannon: sunmy2019: Who will lead this large-scale refactoring? Emma and Kirill as the PEP authors along with any other core devs and folks who want to get involved and have appropriate Rust experience. Brett Cannon: sunmy2019: Who will be responsible for designing the overall code architecture? Who will be making final decisions (for example, how will conflicts with the existing C implementation be resolved)? How can we ensure a stable core team will be able to contribute continuously to this long-term development effort? Is there a communication plan to ensure that progress, challenges, and design changes are transparently communicated to the entire community? How are the project’s key milestones planned? At what point in time or under what circumstances should we reassess the feasibility of these milestones or the overall direction of the project? I don’t think these are really pertinent as they are things we deal with everyday already on the core team in general. Even knowing when to assess success will come down to the SC making a call. I agree with everything Brett says above, but also wanted to add that I am going to spend some time over the next few days on community building around Rust in CPython with a goal of kicking off discussions around a lot of the topics brought up here.
