Clean content: Not a core dev, yet experienced in large scale sw development including changing of core tech. Spoiler alert: these efforts usually fail. I always recommend to answer three key questions before embarking on changing foundational pieces of the stack: Is the new stack introduced for its coolness instead of solving an actual problem? Will the new stack introduce new problems that the old stack does not have? Does the investment in time and effort to introduce the new stack compete with more worthwile work that delivers value to users? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, and the change is pressed on anyway, the outcome will eventually land in one of two states: Efforts will stall and the resulting two-stack system is more complex than ever before, effectively meaning the change will be consuming ever more resources to no good cause. The complexities introduced by the new stack have a far higher blast radius than previously anticipated, triggering a complete rewrite, eventually reaching feature parity with no added value. In short, I recommend to avoid the introduction of Rust as an alternative to C in CPython(!).
