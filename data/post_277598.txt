Clean content: Éric Araujo: Can you expand on this with some specific examples? I can only interpret this as a suggestion that Python releases would include uv and ruff, and it doesn’t make much sense to me. We do already ship with pip and pymanager, and there’s no denying that Rust/Go have created an expectation for modern languages to include quality standard dev tooling. And it is equally apparent that the best Python tooling for the next decade will be written in Rust [1] . So I don’t see a future where Python also ships with such tools as outside the realm of possibility [2] . So I don’t see why not. This is clearly out of scope for this proposal, which is why I framed it only as a future possibility – one that would require its own difficult discussion and the platform/build support this PEP addresses. So I won’t pursue this further here. regardless of if it’s still Astral tools like uv and ruff (or ty when it reaches stable) or something else like pyrefly ↩︎ I do believe replacing pip with uv might just be the most widely applauded move Python can make ↩︎
