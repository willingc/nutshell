Clean content: davidhewitt: mgorny: Admittedly, the wider Python ecosystem with its Rust adoption puts quite a strain on us and the user experience worsens every few months, we still manage to provide a working setup. @mgorny the Python ecosystem user experience is important to me and I’m aware there have been pains as tooling has adopted to Rust support. Gentoo particularly runs into these pains due to so much from-source building and extensive hardware support. I’m sure I’m not aware of every possible configuration, please always do feel free to ping me / direct me at things and I will do my best to help. I build PyO3 / integrate Python & Rust to empower more people to write software, not to alienate. Thank you, and I am grateful for your help whenever we run into specific problems with Rust. Unfortunately, here the problem is Rust itself — for platforms it doesn’t support, all we can do is either drop the package from that platform (which generally means also dropping all the packages that require it) or remove the Rust dependency somehow. For the latter, it often means disabling tests (which is far from optimal, but there’s at least some hope that testing on other platforms will suffice for pure Python packages), and lately replacing uv-build with a pure Python build system (say, when cachecontrol started using it, given it’s required by pip and poetry ).
