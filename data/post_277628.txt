Clean content: Hi from the Rust Compiler Team! As someone who programmed in Python for several years previously, I’m really excited to see this! I haven’t read the entire thread, but I have a minor concern that I previously raised personally with Kirill and wanted to bring here as well. After reading the PEP, one question remains regarding the specific version of Rust that will be used in Python. While Rust maintains excellent stability for the vast majority of users, large foundational projects like CPython often benefit from more conservative versioning strategies. Following approaches used by other large projects, would it make sense to pin specific Rust versions and update deliberately. Additionally, the policy around nightly features isn’t entirely clear. These often contain some quality-of-life improvements that might assist development. Within the Rust compiler itself, we regularly rely on many nightly features, so their treatment remains an open question from the PEP. These are the main points that I feel still need clarification after reading the proposal. Thank you for your tremendous work on integrating Rust into Python – it will be very exciting to watch this progress!
