Clean content: Zander: RustPython already exists today, though it still lags behind CPython in terms of features and ecosystem. Wouldn’t steadily improving it be a more feasible path forward? I don’t think so for a couple of reasons. First, RustPython are semantically different enough that I think merging the semantics would be a significant undertaking: Jeong, YunWon: RustPython isn’t something that can be considered in this PEP in short term. RustPython and CPython are not semantically compatible across many layers of their implementation. Jeong, YunWon: RustPython has its own approach to running without a GIL, but it’s not compatible with CPython’s nogil direction. Second, introducing Rust to CPython would see direct benefits to the millions of users CPython has today. Improving RustPython might see benefits to it’s current user base, but to get current CPython users to switch would need to be earned through proven compatibility over a long time period. That sounds like much more of an uphill battle with unclear benefits.
