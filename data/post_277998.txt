Clean content: Brénainn Woodsend: Slightly tangential but I find optional stdlib components to be a menace and would really like their proliferation to be minimised.

I think therefore it’d be best if a new Rust module was a replacement for an existing C module that could act as a fallback, rather than an entirely new module with no fallback.
