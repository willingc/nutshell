Clean content: I’m not a core dev nor expert in the internals of CPython, but I wanted to chime in to resonate with the question from @MegaIng , pointing out though that it looks to me (as a Python user) that the community in general is more “approachable” in comparison to what happened during the integration of some Rust in the Linux kernel. Out of curiosity, what would this mean for both PyO3 and RustPython ? Have you reached out to the mantainers of the latter for feedback on how to approach this possibility? If so, what’s their opinion? It looks to me like this possible PEP might benefit greatly from their experience (I don’t know if you guys are part of their team, I’m just assuming you’re not but I apologize if that’s incorrect). Also, I’m probably jumping the gun with this question, but since also RustPython seems to be implementing the GIL in a similar fashion, would you expect some challenges in applying PEP 703 efficiently for rust-based extensions? I imagine (or rather, hope) that by the time 3.17 is out that CPython will be completely GIL-less by then. Do you expect that this additional feature will be provided smoothly in Rust extensions as well? Same question applies for the new experimental JIT which should be more stable in future releases. Finally, if I recall rust applications tend to be a bit “bloated” in binary size, although there are some tricks that can be done at compile time to reduce this - what do these tricks imply on performance I have no idea.
