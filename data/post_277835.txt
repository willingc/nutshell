Clean content: Davide Rizzo: I volunteer to support in the endeavor in any way needed. Excellent! Thank you! Davide Rizzo: The technical details can be discussed in due time, but one thing I’d love is for CPython API to define things around ownership and thread safety more formally. Right now this is delegated to documentation, but both C users and foreign language binding implementers (e.g. Rust and C++) would benefit if they could verify that a certain reference is meant to be owned or borrowed and so on. I think that in Linux they have seen a number of improvements by better defining the ownership of various parts of the kernel, so this would be very nice. I think it may be a while before it is feasible, but we shall see! Davide Rizzo: So, please, let’s not disregard that this is a socially loaded topic, and people are already reacting in many ways. I hope that the discussion will be smooth but I will not bet on it. Very important to remember! Going into working on this proposal I was trying to be very cognizant that this topic can engender strong feelings. I think overall I have been pleased with how the discussions have gone so far. I think so far folks have demonstrated that they can engage on this topic in a level-headed and cordial manner. I hope that trend continues. I also hope it has been clear in my own communications that I hope to understand and care about the the views of people who may disagree with the proposal. I do not want to drive away current contributors. I will also re-iterate that if anyone would like to chat about concerns regarding the proposal not in a discussion thread, please feel free to DM me!
